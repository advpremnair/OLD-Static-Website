                          <strong>No two individuals have similar ‘Bhumika’ and the more mystifying or puzzling fact is that the very same person is having his Bhumika being anchored at different ‘ports’ every now and then – hence the dominant shade of Bhumika ruling the person at a given moment is also undergoing changes (for eg: anger, love, success, failure, 
                          historical events, 'isms' … etc). So, each person tries to perceive, understand, analyze and react to the whole world and/or its transactions, issues through their respective ‘Bhumika’ or ‘shade of Bhumika’. Hence there will be material difference in perceptions or observations about the same transactions and/or issues which naturally leads to diversity in judgment, 
                          opinion and conclusion (and the interesting fact is that the very same person also changes his opinion as the ‘shade’ changes). This is the root cause of all conflicts.<br><br>
                          Amazingly, because of the bhumika, to each person it appears or they genuinely feels that their respective stands are correct or justified and others failed in assessing or understanding its true nature. What a biased or imperfect equipment everyone is having or carrying!! Yet all swear by it. This is the magic-of-life (or conflict-in-life). And, the surprising fact is 
                          that majority never understands this and they firmly believe the world and its transactions appears to every-one as it appear to him/her – yet others take foolish decisions - which make him/her to choose the uncompromising position(s), at least for the time being.<br><br>
                          Hence what is needed is: first, admit or understand the limitations of each-ones ‘equipment’ with which we are conducting our ‘serious’ analysis and declarations about everything under the sun (may be above the sun also), and learn to be humble. In the above circumstances, if you are not adamant in anchoring your 'Bhumika-ship' in any particular port and would be bold enough to 
                          continue with your journey through hitherto unchartered terrains ….Yes…then NWO is delighted to point to you a New World, where the different ‘levels’ of ‘Conventional Truth’ and the resultant conflict would wither-away and naturally the New World Order takes you to the lap of ‘Ultimate Truth’.

                          <strong>Have you ever thought of how Science and Technology revolutionize our lives and its environments and bring drastic changes? Starting from, let-us say, invention of (i) ‘Wheel&Axil’ - then the revolutions it brought in the ‘Transportation’ sector in the form of Train, Trucks, Cars, Airplane, and now we are touching ‘Space Tourism’; (ii) Information Technology 
                          (IT) – starting from Printing press, then Telephone and now Digital concepts, Online and Internet; (iii) Energy Sector; (iv) Health Care Products …so on and so forth.<br><br>
                          Out of the above, 21st Centaury is going to witness unprecedented and unparalleled knowledge explosion and the resultant product revolution in the IT sector, which is going to be all Pervasive. So it is going to make drastic changes in all walks of our life, as well as our notions especially about the core concepts like: (i) Truth (ii) Non-violence (iii) Democracy 
                          (iv) Rule of Law (v) Freedom (vi) Equality (vii) Tuning with time (viii) Remedies….etc.<br><br>
                          New World Order Council is trying to re-define the above concepts against the background of the IT revolution, and come out with solutions, which ideally fits to a New World Order [NWO]. Justice delivery system, which falls under ‘Remedies’, mentioned above, is one of our priority areas. The present Legal System is facing challenges at various levels of justice delivery, 
                          staring from the first stage of drafting of Petitions to the final stage of execution of Decree(s). A sizable number of people, who are aggrieved, are not able to seek justice because of the unjustified prohibitive costs and the unpardonable-delay associated with Justice Delivery Mechanisms.<br><br>
                          Online Legal Drafting is – one of such daring steps in a series to follow, towards addressing the said issue(s), from the very starting point, viz, Legal-Drafting, by (i) keeping it with-in reasonable cost(s) as well as addressing the bottle-necks inherent in the system which contributes to (ii) intolerable delay in the justice delivery process by making use of the Digitalization 
                          and Online Internet System(s) - hence NWO and Online Legal Drafting.
