        <p class="card-text text-primary">Gandhi Mission Trust (the Trust, for short) - was established in 2016, with the aims and objectives, among other, for the furtherance and implementation of principles, ideals and action programmes of Mahatma Gandhiji. 
        But, after re-defining the time-related principles and ideals, wherever the changes of time and ground realities of life of a Globalising Age demands it and thereby aids to create an ideal ‘value based society – by accommodating the changing ‘values’.
        <br><br>Mahatma Gandhi once said that: “there is necessity to continually make changes in our institutions and systems to suit to the needs of changing times”. We strictly follow these prophetic words and ...  Yes... we believe... 
        that we have reached a point in history, which calls for changes in existing concepts, as he himself has directed. 
        <br><br>Hence, our dream Program “A Gram-Swaraj fit for the Online Digital Age and Global Village”. Online-legal-drafting - is one of the Projects under the aforesaid Program launched by the Trust and the NWO Council jointly. Other online projects, which will take this Program to its logical end are on the anvil.</p>

                      <br>For keeping this communication as brief as possible we have purposely avoided referring to, at least for the time being, the 234 different ‘isms’ (believed to be documented so far...) and its connected Doctrines, each representing a philosophical, political or moral doctrine or a belief system, such as Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, Atheism, Religious faiths...etc. 
                      <br>Apart from keeping this brief, there are also other valid grounds, majority of such ‘isms’ basically deals with the distribution of the resources or assets or income, which we are otherwise dealing under clause (iii) and (iv) above. Similarly, other ‘isms’ (a) dealing with various religious undertones are covered under cl(ii) Religion and 
                      (b) different types of administrative machinery are covered under cl(i) Nationalism.<br> Our journey is scheduled to begin from the 'State' of Kerala from a date to be announced shortly.
