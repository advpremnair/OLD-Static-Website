                <p class="description">Gandhi Mission Trust - was established on 22nd day of January, 2016 at Kollam, Kerala State. The Trust is currently working on a Program - ‘A Grama-Swaraj fit for the digital age’, which consists of multiple Online-Projects.<br> 
                  <br>
                  Gandhiji preferred the term ‘Swaraj’ to describe what he called true democracy. He wants to see each village a little republic enjoying the maximum freedom and advocated Panchayat Raj - a decentralized form of Government where each village is responsible for its own affairs, as the foundation of India's political system and wanted political power to be distributed among the villages in India.<br>
                  <br>
                  The term for such a vision was Gram Swaraj. Gandhiji’s concept of democratic decentralization or true democracy bears the stamp of his passionate belief in non-violence, truth and individual freedom.<br>
                  <br>
                  Tuning to the digital age - Mahatma Gandhi once said that “there is necessity to continually make changes in our institutions and systems to suit to the needs of changing times”. Digital technologies, including online tools, are revolutionizing: (i) the existing conventional interaction amoung people (ii) the  democratic decision-making process World-over, (iii) the way public authorities and other institutions interact with citizens (iv) service-delivery platforms/systems and also (v) throws open innovative opportunities arising from the new Globalization concepts.<br>
                  <br>
                  One of the rare positive effects of the un-fortunate Pandemic is the acceleration in wide-spread and compulsive use of the digital technologies even in Educational Institutions and Villages. At the same time, we are aware, digital engagement is limited by people's technical skills as well as the availability of necessary gadgets. Hence we are also working on plans to impart required quality technical skills at the grass-root level and support community centers providing the required gadgets, by joining hands with other interested stake-holders.<br>
                  <br>
                  Online-legal-drafting - is one of such Projects launched by Gandhi Mission Trust under the aforesaid Program. The Indian legal system is facing challenges at various levels of justice delivery, staring from the drafting of petition stage to the execution. A number of people who are aggrieved are not able to seek justice because of the prohibitive costs of litigation and the delays that come along with them. Online legal drafting is a daring step towards addressing the said issue(s), by keeping it with-in reasonable cost(s) as well as removing the bottle-necks inherent in the system with the help of digitalization.<br>  
                  <br>
                  Good governance demands respect for human rights, rule of law, strengthening of democracy, promoting transparency - which implies openness, communication, and accountability in public administration. The responsiveness of the state and its institutions to the needs and aspirations of the people, and inclusive citizenship are imperative to good governance. Gandhiji aimed at the individual the centre of the local administration. According to him, the village is the lowest unit of a decentralized system. Politically a village has to be small enough to permit everyone to participate directly in the decision-making process. This results in inclusive citizenship - which is a form of direct democracy in which all citizens are involved in policy making and the government of their city in a bottom-up way rather than top-down. This age of digitalization and online services has also thrown open new avenues, hitherto un-accessible because of physical separation and prohibitive costs associated with communication and transfer of documents thus bringing even many arms of the state and central Government within the concept of inclusive citizenship.<br>  
                  <br>
                  Social Audit - The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has issued specific guidelines to make  Gram Sabha  (i) as a vibrant forum for promoting planned economic and social development of the villages in a transparent way, (ii) as a Key to the self-governance as well as a transparent and accountable functioning (iii) as a forum that ensures direct, participative democracy. But the studies of several distinguished scholars on the working of the Panchayat Raj in different States and the Status Report of the Ministry of Panchayat Raj lead us to the inference that the Gandhian ideal of Gram Swaraj remains an unfinished agenda even after decades of the implementation of the Panchayat Raj.<br> 
                  <br>
                  We fully believe in the Gandhian concept of Panchayat Raj - as a vehicle that is most ideal to initiate both political and economic democracy at the grassroots level, but it needs to be tuned to the challenges of a changing society in the era of Globalization.Therefore, concerted, systematic and sustained endeavors are needed on the part of those for whom Gram Swaraj remains a cherished dream for the empowerment of people and for making national development of India a participatory democracy.<br>
                  <br>
                  No doubt, Villages have always been the basic units of administration in India since ancient times. The Gram Sabha can become the cornerstone of the whole Panchayat Raj institutional set-up, thereby the Indian democratic system, but as Gandiji rightly observed “there is necessity to continually make changes in our institutions and systems to suit to the needs of changing times”. Yes, thus we have reached a point in history, which calls for redefining of the existing concepts. Hence, our Program “A Grama-Swaraj fit for the digital age” and the first step towards it is “Online Legal Drafting”. Other online programs which will take this Program to its logical end are in the anvil</p>.
