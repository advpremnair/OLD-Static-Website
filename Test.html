        <p class="card-text text-primary">Gandhi Mission Trust (the Trust, for short) - was established in 2016, with the aims and objectives, among other, for the furtherance and implementation of principles, ideals and action programmes of Mahatma Gandhiji. 
        But, after re-defining the time-related principles and ideals, wherever the changes of time and ground realities of life of a Globalising Age demands it and thereby aids to create an ideal ‘value based society – by accommodating the changing ‘values’.
        <br><br>Mahatma Gandhi once said that: “there is necessity to continually make changes in our institutions and systems to suit to the needs of changing times”. We strictly follow these prophetic words and ...  Yes... we believe... 
        that we have reached a point in history, which calls for changes in existing concepts, as he himself has directed. 
        <br><br>Hence, our dream Program “A Grama-Swaraj fit for the Online Digital Age and Global Village”. Online-legal-drafting - is one of the Projects under the aforesaid Program launched by the Trust and the NWO Council jointly. Other online projects, which will take this Program to its logical end are on the anvil.</p>

              No two individuals have similar ‘Bhumika’. They try to perceive, understand and react to the whole world and/or its transactions, issues from their respective ‘Bhumika’ – This is the root cause of all conflicts.
              And, the surprising fact is that majority never understands this and they firmly believe the world and its transactions appears to every-one as it appear to him/her – which make them to choose the uncompromising position(s). 
              Hence let us first admit the limitations of our ‘equipment’ with which we are conducting analysis of the various core concept(s) including: (i) Individual, (ii) Family, (iii) Society, (iv) State and (v) World – and its interactions at different levels,

              For the time being let us limit our discussion to the "conventional" truth. The NWO Council found in their research that TRUTH HAS DIFFERENT SHADES OR LEVELS, as long as you only see it from the ‘bhumika’ you have been deeply entrenched.
              As time passes or because of changes in any of the ingredients of your ‘bhumika’, then...Yes, you begin to perceive the other shades of truth or rather levels of truth, and your hitherto firmly held belief systems begin to lose its self-protected boundaries and you begin to feel the changing breeze...

              The NWO Council works on a wider platform, for example, amoung other, we intends to re-define the tenets of (i) ‘Nationalism’ (ii) ‘Religion’(iii) ‘Ownership and Distribution of Natural resources’ as well as the connected other ‘Economic resources’(iv) ‘Administrative Systems’ etc... 
              <br>The very moment you do that successfully, the physical boundaries of the ‘Nations’ as well as the 99.99% of major cause(s) for War and the apparent conflict arising from individuals Bhoomika will disappear.<br> You don’t need a Military to run this World!! Sounds un-believable? (No, we are not Kidding!). We knew, you may find it difficult to digest it in one go, 
              don’t worry, we will be putting it in step by step and in its natural evolution process of ideas.<br>And we are sure you will be amazed to perceive about the ease with which today's World disappears and the New Global Village emerges in its totality, at least until an ‘Alien’ appears in the scene. 
              <br>For keeping this communication as brief as possible we have purposely avoided referring to, at least for the time being, the 234 different ‘isms’ (believed to be documented so far...) and its connected Doctrines, each representing a philosophical, political or moral doctrine or a belief system, such as Capitalisam, Communisam, Socialisam, Atheism, Religious faiths...etc. 
              <br>Apart from keeping this brief, there are also other valid grounds, majority of such ‘isams’ basically deals with the distribution of the resources or assets or income, which we are otherwise dealing under clause (iii) and (iv) above. Similarly, other ‘isams’ (a) dealing with various religious undertones are covered under cl(ii) Religion and 
              (b) different types of administrative machinery are covered under cl(i) Nationalism.<br> Our journey is scheduled to begin from the 'State' of Kerala from a date to be announced shortly.
